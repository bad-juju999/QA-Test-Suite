<h1>QA Test Suite</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/)

<h2>Description</h2>

- This project is a custom QA automation suite focused on end-to-end regression, smoke and development tests. In this project I was focused on using Gherkin syntax for learning the basics of Behavior Driven Development (BDD).
- Initially used Cameron Bradley's Cucumber + Playwright course for learning best practices and file structure.
